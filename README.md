## Random Number Generators with Fixed Seeds

### - Random number generators with fixed seeds have been included to ensure the reproducibility of the results as described in my report.

### - The results are robust to changes of the seeds.

### - All seeds have been set to 46853 at the top of each document of code, below the imported libraries. The results are reproducible by using this seed.

---

Task 1 (Grid Game) - Uses numpy random with a seed of 46853.

Task 2 (MNIST Dataset Neural Network) - Uses numpy random with a seed of 46853.

Task 3 (PyTorch) - Uses numpy random and PyTorch random with seeds of 46853.
